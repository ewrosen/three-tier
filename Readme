This is a simple read me file for a three tier NGINX example

Intro
- This example is composed of a docker-compose file at the root of this repository and three directories.  The three directories contain dockerfiles and relevant configs for each container.  
- Containers are as follows
 - reverse-proxy
   - handles all incoming http/https request associated with url "containers"
 - front-end
   - Authenticates users to https://container/mysecretkey
   - Passes testuser to backend server hosting secret info at https://container/secretfiles after authentication
   - Hosts https://container/ 
   - Hosts https://container/fallback for any other uri requests
 - back-end
   - Hosts secrets at https://containers/secretfiles

Getting started
- Pull down this repo
- add "container" to /etc/hosts to resolve to localhost "127.0.0.1       container"
- To build this example you just need to run the docker-compose file in the base directory.  This docker-compose file will call the Dockerfile in each subdirectory and build everything needed
 - docker-compose up --build -d

Testing
- browse to https://container/mysecretkey to test auth and access to secret backend server
- browse to http://container/ to test http to https 
- browse to https//container/foo/foo to test uri cleanup

Authentication information
- http auth user:testuser password:testuser
- http static token is uri mysecretkey https://container/mysecretkey
